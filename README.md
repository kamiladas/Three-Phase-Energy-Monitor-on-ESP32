## Three-Phase Energy Monitor on ESP32

### Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation details for a three-phase energy monitor based on the ESP32 microcontroller. This project is intended to provide an accurate, cost-effective solution for monitoring electrical energy usage in real-time across three-phase power systems.

### Key Features
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Displays real-time energy consumption for three-phase systems.
- **Wi-Fi Connectivity:** Allows remote monitoring and control via the ESP32â€™s Wi-Fi capabilities.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system comes with a simple, intuitive web interface for easy interaction.
- **Customizable Settings:** Users can easily reset to factory settings, change the password, configure time zones, and set up Wi-Fi connections.

### Hardware
The heart of the project is a custom-designed PCB interfacing with the ESP32 microcontroller. You can find the design files and more details in the following link:
