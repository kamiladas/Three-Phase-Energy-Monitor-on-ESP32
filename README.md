# Three-Phase Energy Monitor on ESP32

## Overview
This repository contains the design and implementation details for a three-phase energy monitor based on the ESP32 microcontroller. This project is intended to provide an accurate, cost-effective solution for monitoring electrical energy usage in real-time across three-phase power systems.

## Key Features
- Real-time energy measurement for three-phase systems.
- Utilizes ESP32 for Wi-Fi connectivity and advanced processing capabilities.
- Compact and efficient PCB design.
- Open source software for data logging and analysis.

## Hardware
The core of the energy monitor is a custom-designed PCB that interfaces with the ESP32 microcontroller. The design files for this PCB are available for viewing and modification at the following link:
